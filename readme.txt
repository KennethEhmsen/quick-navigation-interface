Allows you to quickly access any link within wp-admin just by typing the first few letters.


== Description ==

Intent-Driven Interface provides a new way to navigate through the Administration Panels, combining the speed of keyboard shortcuts with the ease of a graphical user interface.

Just press alt-w to bring up the interface, and then start typing what you want to do. As you type, you'll be shown a list of matching links. Use the up and down keys to move between them, and press enter to open one.

This was inspired by the Ubuntu's [Dash](todo) and [HUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfmSTWyYbms), and is also similar to the Spotlight feature in OS X.
