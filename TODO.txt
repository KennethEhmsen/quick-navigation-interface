### Design

* Mock up the screen
* Break into Backbone templates when start implementing behavior


### Behavior

* Listen for alt-w, add active class to dialog when heard
* Create Backbone models, collections and views for the interface
	* One collection for all links (to search against)
	* Another collection for matches (to display)
* Watch search input and filter the active collection based on it
	* Find a good JS implementation of levenstein
	* Search by title alone, or title + url?
* For WP menus, add in siblings with a higher distance than query matches
* Capture up and down keys and move active class to corresponding list items


### Misc

* Setup Grunt to generate concatenated/minified css/js
* When committing 0.1 to wporg repo, save screenshots to assets dir instead of plugin dir
* make sure alt-w doesn't conflict w/ any browser shortcuts
* Listen for new links added by JS?
* Include content in results?
