### Design

* Break into Backbone templates when start implementing behavior
* Add X to close


### Behavior

* Create Backbone models, collections and views for the interface
	* One collection for all links (to search against)
	* Another collection for matches (to display)
* Watch search input and filter the active collection based on it
	* Find a good JS implementation of Levenshtein

	* Search by title alone, or title + url?
* For WP menus, add in siblings with a higher distance than query matches
* Capture up and down keys and move active class to corresponding list items


### Misc

* Make sure ` doesn't conflict w/ any browser shortcuts.
* Setup Grunt to generate concatenated/minified css/js


### 0.1 launch
* When committing to wporg repo, save screenshots to assets dir instead of plugin dir



### v2
* Include content in results
	* Use Jetpack Omnisearch under the hood
	* Maybe fallback to a basic post/comment search if Omnisearch not available
	* Build an index mapping urls to keywords and titles
		* store in transient, then enqueue as .json file, separate from normal js file, so it can be cached client side rather than sent with every page
		* use an efficient structure like a b-tree.
		* omnisearch indexs with elasticsearch on wpcom? check if cache results locally. maybe just copy that index and add on-page links to it, then send to client.
		* search that file for content, on-page links, everything. that way don't have to submit ajax request for every search
	* Listen for new links added by JS?
